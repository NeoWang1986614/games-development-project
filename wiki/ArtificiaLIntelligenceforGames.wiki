Kinematic Movement algorithms

Kinematic movement algorithms use static datea (position and orientation, no velocitis) and output a desired velocity.  The output is often simply an on or off and  a target direction, moving at full speed or being stationary.  Kinematic algorithms do not use acceleration, although the abrupt changes in velocity might be smoothed over several frames.

Many games simplify things even further and force the orientation of a character to be in the direction it is travelling. If the character is stationary, it faces either a preset direction or the last direction it was moving in.  If its movement algorithm returns a target velocity, then that is used to set its orientation. 

This can be done simply with the function.

************************************************************************

def getNewOrientation(currentOrientation, velocity):


  # Make sure we have a velocity
    if velocity.length() > 0:

  # Calculate orientation using an arc tangent of
  # the velocity components.
  return atan2(-static.x, static.z)

  # Otherwise use the current orientation
  else: return currentOrientation

************************************************************************

Seek behaviour

A kinematic seek behaviour takes as input the character's and their target's static data.  It calculates the direction from the character to the target and requests a velocity along this line.  The orientation values are typically ignored, altough we can use the getNewOrientation function above to face in the direction we are moving.
  
The algorithm can be implemented in a few lines:

************************************************************************

class KinematicSeek:

#Holds the static data for the character and target
 character
 target

#Holds the maximum speed the character the character can travel 
maxSpeed

def getSteering():

  #Create the structure for output
  steering = new KinematicSteeringOutput()

  # Get the direction to the target
  steering.velocity =
  target.position - character.position

  # The velocity is along this direction, at full speed
  steering.velocity.normalize()
  steering.velocity x= maxSpeed

  #Face in the direction we want to move
  character.orientation =
     getNewOrientation(character.orientation,
                       steering.velocity)

  # Output the steering
  steering.rotation = 0
  
  return steering

************************************************************************

where the normalize method applies to a vector and makes sure it has a length of one. If the vector is a zero vector, then it is left unchanged.

________________________________________________________________________

Flee

If we want the character to run away from their target, we can simply reverse the second line of the getSteering method to give.

************************************************************************

# Get the direction away from the target
steering.velocity = character.position - target.position

************************************************************************

The character will then move at maximum velocity in the opposite direction.
